# Flutter Hugo CMS (Desktop + mobile)

This Hugo CMS is made with flutter, an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

Flutter desktop is still available only in alpha version in the Flutter dev channel.
